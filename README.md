# Web-Scraper
####Scrape the text from any website. I was bored late at night, and thanks to IBM's Alchemy, it took me less than 60 lines of code to make this work. 

###1) First create an IBM Bluemix Account, and get an api key for Alchemy.

###2) Add the API key into the code and you are ready to go.
